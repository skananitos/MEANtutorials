For the history of the modern nation-state, see History of modern Greece. (From Wikipedia)</p><p>The history of Greece encompasses the history of the territory of the modern state of Greece, as well as that of the Greek people and the areas they ruled historically.<br>The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied much through the ages, and, as a result, the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes. Each era has its own related sphere of interest.</p><p>The first (proto-) Greek-speaking tribes, are generally thought to have arrived in the Greek mainland between the late 3rd and the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, probably between 1900 and 1600 BC.

Since then, Greek minorities have remained in former Greek territories or other territories colonised by Greeks (e.g., Turkey, Albania, Italy, and Libya, Levant, Armenia, Georgia, etc.), and Greek emigrants have assimilated into differing societies across the globe (e.g., North America, Australia, Northern Europe, South Africa, etc.).

The Minoan civilization was the first civilization in Europe and the first, in Europe, to build a palace. After the Minoan civilization was devastated by the Thera eruption, Crete developed an Ancient Greece-influenced organization of city states, then successively became part of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, autonomous state, and the modern state of Greece.</p><span>Search contents: </span><input type="text" name="cName"><h3>Minoan-Mycenaean Crete</h3><p><i>Ancient Crete</i></p><p><i>Minoan civilization</i></p><h3>Heraklion Archaeological Museum</h3><p>Opening Hours:</p><span>Museum is closed</span><h5>Museum Cafe </h5><p>Do you want something to drink?
